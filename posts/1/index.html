Since Python is the easiest language for me to put down and pick back up I’ve opted for doing these in that language, though I might see about returning to some of these in other languages.</p><p>These programming challenges come from a phone app linked up to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/">r/dailyprogrammer</a>. Today I’m looking at a Beginner Challenge, Knuth’s Arrow, just for simplicity.</p><p><strong><em>(BEGINNER) Knuth’s Arrow:</em></strong><br>For a lot of these programming challenges the hardest part is often trying to figure out just what the concept behind the challenge is. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In mathematics, Knuth’s up-arrow notation is a method of notation for very large integers, introduced by Donald Knuth in 1976.</p></blockquote><p>Essentially, Knuth arrow is iterated exponentiation, the same way exponentiation is basically just iterated multiplication and multiplication is iterated addition. So one 2↑2 is the same as 2^2, since there’s only one arrow.</p><p><img src="/static/images/program_posts/DP_part1/dp_knuth_ex.png" alt="Knuth in Action"></p><p>Thankfully, the reason this problem is ‘beginner’ is because Knuth Arrow follows a pretty simple formula that just needs to be replicated in code:</p><p><img src="/static/images/program_posts/DP_part1/dp_knuth.png" alt="Big Easy Formula"></p><p>So, this is exactly as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">Wikipedia</a> says:</p><blockquote><p>“…more than one arrow means iterating the operation associated with one less arrow.”</p></blockquote><p>Right away this can be seen as a recursion problem. It’s just compounding knuth arrow formulas on top of one another until you reach one of two terminating cases. Thus, the program is fairly short:</p><p><img src="/static/images/program_posts/DP_part1/dp_knuth_prog.png" alt="The Program!"></p><p>For the sake of simplicity, it just runs with test values. Here shown it’s given test values 2↑↑4. This is expected to produce 2↑(2↑(2↑2)) or 65536. Checking our output we see that the program outputs exactly that:</p><p><img src="/static/images/program_posts/DP_part1/dp_knuth_out.png" alt="Knuth in Action"></p><p>Some of the challenge input include 5↑↑↑↑5 and 7↑↑↑↑↑3. This is an excellent way to test the output. Problem is, when I ran with these inputs (ie 5,5,4) the program would seemingly hang. A couple of print statements showed the problem. Or rather the lack of a problem. When they say the Knuth arrow is used to denote massive numbers they’re not kidding. 5↑↑↑↑5 has intermediate numbers that fill up multiple screens with digits you have to scroll through. It’s likely integers on my computer aren’t equipped to simply <em>print out</em> numbers from a Knuth arrow. Thus, later I’ll need to do a rewrite that simple strings a string for the full knuth arrow equation with no computation.</p><p>Right now on my programming challenges Repo I have unfinished code for creating Ducci sequences, so finishing that up will be my next goal when I can find the time.</p><p>~Nicko</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">22nd August 2018 3:27 am</p><h1><a href="/blog/2018/08/22/broken-bootloaders-and-occam&#x27;s-razor/">Broken Bootloaders and Occam&#x27;s Razor</a></h1><p><img src="/static/images/general_posts/razor/p1_intro.png" alt="Black Screen of Death"></p><p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Occam’s razor is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the right one.</p></blockquote><p>My PC has a dualboot with 2 Operating Systems, Linux Mint and Windows 10. These two love to bicker and fight when it comes to booting the PC, such as Safe Boot in the BIOS favoring the Windows bootloader over GRUB or otherwise trying to override a Linux liveboot. Even so, I still keep it this way. Linux is for work, professional and personal, and Windows is for play (and any work that can’t be done on Linux).</p><p>So the input of the commodore 64 perceptron was put off today for a little computer fixing time, these OSes at each other’s throats again. A few days ago a brown-out occured in the house, shutting off my PC. The thing is a monster that I built myself, but its software can sometimes be a jenga tower ready to topple over.</p><p>When I turned my PC back on I found GRUB in shambles. That is to say it couldn’t find, well, itself. So instead of giving me a handy list of loaders to choose from it just went straight to GRUB Rescue, a black screen/white text shell some people have the gall to call ‘powerful’. No, the rescue terminal is no BASH, not by a long shot.</p><p><img src="/static/images/general_posts/razor/p1_glgb.png" alt="Good Luck, God Bless, We&#39;re All Rooting for You"></p><p>This wasn’t the first time I’ve seen this screen. When I first built my PC this happened when I tried to load into the old Mint 17 I already had installed on my C Drive. I had to manually start up the GRUB menu from the rescue terminal in order to get into Linux to make sure everything was in order. Unfortunately, this time it wasn’t so simple.</p><p>Trying to do what I did before I hit hurdle after hurdle. First, all my drives were unknown filesystems, meaning I had to comb through the lot of the drives to find the one where my Linux was hiding. From there I had to set up the root and tell GRUB where normal.mod was. Except it kept trying to look for normal in /boot/grub/i386/.</p><p>This was confusing consider I had a 64 bit machine, x86, not a 32 bit one. In fact, I could even ls my way into /boot/grub/ to find normal.mod hiding in a folder called /x86_64-efi/. So the file was there but grub was, for some reason, looking in the wrong spot.</p><p>Combing through the internet, I began a tangled web of trying to fix this issue. I created a liveUSB of Linux Mint so I could use the terminal to reinstall grub but I needed to mount my C drive to the /mnt/ folder in root but it’d claim to not be able to find a file at a specific location despite the fact I had a file explorer open and I was <em>staring right at the file it said it couldn’t find right where it said it couldn’t find it</em>.</p><p><img src="/static/images/general_posts/razor/p1_gfdi.png" alt="Madness and Aimlessness"></p><p>In my mad scramble for a solution to this increasingly maddening problem, I stumbled across a very short post in response to someone else tangled in the web of chaos that was GRUB messing up:</p><blockquote><p>Easier just to use Boot-Repair. Boot Repair -Also handles LVM, GPT, separate /boot and UEFI dual boot.: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair</a></p></blockquote><p>As it turns out, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair/">a tool called Boot Repair</a> existed. You could load up the iso into a USB stick like a Linux liveboot, and it even had a cute little mini-desktop where you could check your drives before running a two-click wizard that instantly fixed it.</p><p>I rebooted and everything worked. GRUB menu worked just fine, both OSes boot a-okay.</p><p>Terminals and file crawling and errors that make no sense while combing through forum post after forum post…</p><p>versus a USBstick and two clicks.</p><p>Occam’s Razor holds true, as it turns out. It’s just a shame it also makes me feel like a proper idiot.</p><p>~Nicko</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">19th August 2018 4:11 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2018/08/19/machine-learning-on-a-commodore64-(part-1)/">Machine Learning on a Commodore64 (part 1)</a></h1><p><img src="/static/images/retro_posts/c64_learning/p1_intro.png" alt="The Future In The Past"></p><p>Recently I downloaded <a href="http://www.ccs64.com/">an Emulator for the Commodore 64</a> and was also reminded of the fact that anachronisms are funny. This is why, when trying to think of projects to tackle with this old thing, I thought it’d be fun to see how far I could take Machine Learning on the ol’ 6510 Processor.</p><p>I, myself, own a VIC-20. I haven’t brought it out of its box for a long while, having been distracted by other things, so my BASIC is a little rusty. So, what better way to start this project than to try and implement one of the more simple learning machines, the Perceptron. Old methods for old machines.</p><p><img src="/static/images/retro_posts/c64_learning/nicvic20.jpg" alt="Nic and the Vic"></p><p>Should this work, I’d like to see just how far I can go. I’m doubtful I’ll be able to go much further without breaking into C64 Machine Code (which I may very well do). My ultimate goal is to have this running on my Vic-20, so for now this is just a proof of concept, sorta. As in, if the C64 can’t do it, the poor Vic sure can’t.</p><p>This first version of this will be simple, manually inputting training values with expected output. The skeleton roadmap is as follows:</p><p><img src="/static/images/retro_posts/c64_learning/p1_pc1.png" alt="Code 01"></p><p>Here, I’m doing an easy version of the perceptron. No input_0 &amp; weight_0, I’m opting for a regular bias. Also, I decided to keep the learning rate at 1 so I’m not including it in the math.</p><p>The hiccup here is “what format does data come in”? Well, again, for simplicity I’ll probably keep it as a string of 1s and 0s and it’ll be binary classification. With a string, we can break it into a list of chars and do a VAL(X$) on each to get their numeric value. For each one. It’s sloppy, but it <em>should</em> get the job done.</p><p>As for reconnecting with Commodore BASIC, most videos were a little slow paced, feeling first the need to explain “no there isn’t a mouse” and “no you can’t get Windows on C64” before explaining and re-explaining the history of the processor. Thankfully, I’m able to kick it like it’s the early 80s and read from the user’s manual quick reference for the C64 (an online scan, of course).</p><p>For my first hack at it, I wrote this out:</p><p><img src="/static/images/retro_posts/c64_learning/p1_c1.png" alt="Code 01"></p><p>Again, my BASIC V2 is really rusty so I’m probably missing something here. There’s a lot of string to real conversion knocking about in this code which makes me nervous. That was the easiest way to break apart a string of 1s and 0s. I’d do a little magic with mod10, but if the string began with a 0 I’m worried it’d be lost (ie 0101 becomes 101). Else it’d just halt the program. I’ll give it a try in the emulator when I have time tomorrow.</p><p>~Nicko</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">16th August 2018 4:18 am</p><h1><a href="/blog/2018/08/16/test-post!/">Welcome to the Blog!</a></h1><p>Heya!</p><p>This is Nicholas Casteen reporting in.
